### Enabling rapid response problems

The files in this example directory will help you to configure LMS/Studio to use rapid response problems
via the [rapid-response-xblock](https://github.com/mitodl/rapid-response-xblock) repo.

To get it working:
1. Copy the yml file to the root of this repo.
1. Copy the JSON patch file into the `configpatch` directory. 
1. Follow the instructions in the main `README` to run devstack with `docker-compose-rapid-response.yml` as one of the docker-compose config files.
